# Project 2 gamesome sort of game.

## Getting started
You'll need:
- Python 3
- Pip
- pipenv

Pip is a package manager that is included with Python, what pip allows us to do is download modules!

Pipenv is to keep this python environment seperate from the one installed on your system to prevent clutter and too much
disk space use.

To instal pipenv execute
```
pip install pipenv
```

If that is installed go to the directory where this repo is located and execute
```
pipenv shell
```

This will initialize and install the needed modules to make this project run.

For project 2 we need to make a game.
